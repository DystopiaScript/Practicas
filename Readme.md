Hello, whoever that is viewing this repository, in the next lines I go to say some aclarations of these practices:

1. The practice 1.1 and 1 is the same, but with a different code, this is because in the class view a diferent way to how do the practice, so the 1.1 is the code that view in class and 1 is the code in the "Reporte sabatico Manual" of the teacher Alexander.

2. The Practice 2 is in the Practice2.md, you need click in the link (is lucichart link) and there are 3 clases in UML (Unified Modeling Language)
